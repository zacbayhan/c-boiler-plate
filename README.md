#  options.c

	Objective: 

	The objective of this program is to a montocarlo simulation on current options contracts 
prices utilizing the Black-Scholes equation to attempt to guess future options prices. The Black-Scholes
equation is generally used to gauge prices on a European call system (contracts end). 


	Road Map: 


		* Ingest current options listings  (paython?)

		* Write serilized version of simulation (c mostlikely)

		* Rewrite to MPI or Cuda (definently c)


	Thoughts: 

		* Where is this data goign to come from...
